# Harper + Nextjs Ecommerce Template

This project is a basic ecommerce template that demonstrates a fullstack [Harper](https://www.harpersystems.dev/) powered [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application.

Harper provides the backend database, API, caching, and a server to run the Next.js frontend on. The same patterns in this code can be used to run any app that requires dynamic data and/or caching.

Almost 2% of global ecommerce sales flow through Harper Systems, with an average p95 latency of 1.12ms across early hints, redirects, and product page lookups for real-world e-commerce applications. See the LCP stats for yourself by opening the Chrome devtools performance tab on our [live demo](https://test-kgdemo.harperdbcloud.com:9926/).

## More Information
For more information about getting started with Harper and building your Next.js applications, see our [getting started guides and documentation](https://www.harperdb.io/development/technologies/next-js).

This template includes the [default configuration](./config.yaml), which specifies how files are handled in your application.

The [schema.graphql](./schema.graphql) is the schema definition. This is the main starting point for defining your database schema, specifying which tables you want and what attributes/fields they should have.

The [resources.js](./resources.js) provides a template for defining JavaScript resource classes, for customized application logic in your endpoints. This repo comes with sample product data in a json file.
